    "# The Increasing Cost of Healthcare in America\n",
    "\n",
    "A while back, I was looking for some real-world data to use to enhance my skills in Supervised Machine Learning with Sklearn  and graphing with Matplotlib. At that time, politics happened to be happening, and the topic of healthcare was brought up. A lot. And so, I searched for and found The National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA)'s data on U.S. spending on healthcare since 1960 on [CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical)\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning the data to remove the commas and convert the strings to floats, I did some Exporitory Data Analysis by making some simple graphs to look at how the cost of healthcare has changed. I started with the obvious graph of the total amount of spending per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='Graphs/Healthcare Cost.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first things I noticed looking at the graph is the non-linearity of the growth in spending. I would have assumed the increase would be a straight line, possibly in coordination with, if slightly above, the rate of inflation. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the next graph I went for was the cost as a percent of GDP, which would enable me to see how the costs increased relative to inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='Graphs/Healthcare Cost vs GDP.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "I added the exact percent of a few years where the percent GDP seemingly flatlined, for perspective. The code used is written below.\n",

I want to make it clear that I do not believe this to be the more accurate estimator, despite is being closer to correct on the costs in 2018. The fact that is uses older data, and less data, is the reason that it greatly underestimated most of the years since the late 80s and was seemingly only correct at the end of flatline years. But I still wanted to leave this graph here as a low estimator.\n",
